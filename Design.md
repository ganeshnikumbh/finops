Design Document: AWS FinOps Application using Trusted Advisor
üß© 1. Objective
Build a FinOps application that:

Fetches AWS Trusted Advisor recommendations using AWS APIs.

Displays these in a Vue.js frontend.

Allows users to implement each recommendation via an "Implement" button.

Executes backend automation (via Flask or FastAPI) to remediate issues automatically.

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Components
3.1 Frontend (Vue.js)
Components:

RecommendationList.vue: Display recommendations in a table.

RecommendationItem.vue: Individual recommendation card or row.

Functionality:

Fetch list of Trusted Advisor checks and results.

Display health status, category, and description.

Implement button triggers backend call for that recommendation.

Filter by cost, performance, security, etc.

3.2 Backend (Flask or FastAPI)
Endpoints:

GET /recommendations: Fetch and return Trusted Advisor checks.

POST /implement/<check_id>: Execute remediation script.

Authentication: Use IAM roles or STS tokens to access AWS APIs securely.

Trusted Advisor Integration:

Use boto3.client('support') to list checks and get check results.

Map check IDs to automation logic.

3.3 Automation Layer
Scripts:

EC2 idle instances ‚Üí Stop or terminate EC2 instances.

Unused EBS volumes ‚Üí Delete or snapshot.

S3 bucket versioning not enabled ‚Üí Enable it.

Execution:

Use boto3 modules (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.).

Ensure idempotency and include rollback options.

üîê 4. Security
Authentication: Use AWS Cognito or IAM roles.

Authorization: Limit which users can implement which recommendations.

Logging: Log all actions using AWS CloudWatch or application logs.

Audit Trail: Store executed actions and user who triggered them.

üì¶ 5. Deployment
Frontend: Hosted via AWS Amplify or S3 + CloudFront.

Backend: Hosted in AWS Lambda (via Zappa) or EC2/Fargate.

Secrets: Use AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and credentials.

CI/CD: Use GitHub Actions or CodePipeline.
